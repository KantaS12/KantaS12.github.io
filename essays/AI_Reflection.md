## Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming many fields, and education is no exception. In software engineering, AI serves as a powerful tool to streamline development processes and enhance learning. Its relevance is growing as AI-powered tools are now integrated into many professional and academic environments. This integration provides students with new ways to understand complex concepts, write code more efficiently, and debug problems.

The primary AI tool I have used in general and in ICS 314 is Google Gemini.

## Personal Experience with AI

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
2. In-class Practice WODs
3. In-class WODs
4. Essays
5. Final project
6. Learning a concept / tutorial
7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
8. Asking or answering a smart-question
9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
10. Explaining code
11. Writing code
12. Documenting code
13. Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”
14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

The incorporation of AI has had a mixed but ultimately positive impact on my learning experience. For example, when learning about asynchronous programming, I could get a concise analogy and a simple code example from Gemini, which was a great starting point for my understanding.

## Practical Applications

Outside of ICS 314, I've applied AI to a real-world project by developing a Personal Knowledge Tracker + Smart Note Recommender. This web application serves as a personal dashboard that tracks daily learning (notes, links, summaries) and then uses natural language processing (NLP) to suggest review items or related concepts, effectively functioning as my own AI-powered "second brain."

In addressing real-world software engineering challenges, this AI application has been highly effective. It automates the organization and retrieval of information, a common challenge in personal knowledge management. The intelligent recommendation system helps combat information overload and improves learning retention by prioritizing relevant content for review. This project demonstrates how AI can be leveraged to create personalized, adaptive tools that enhance productivity and learning beyond traditional methods.


## Challenges and Opportunities

A major challenge I faced was the potential for AI hallucinations. Gemini would sometimes provide confident but incorrect code or explanations, which was both misleading and frustrating to debug. Additionally, the code it generated was often generic and lacked context. It rarely followed the specific architectural patterns or style guides of a project, which meant I had to spend a lot of time manually refining it.
